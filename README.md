# Groq Cloud Link
This is an unofficial integration to integrate the Groq Cloud with Home assistant.

This is a bare-minimum proof of concept, but has a few features
 * Streaming responses from Groq
 * Tool use **if you select the correct model** such as controlling lights and switches
 * Config flow UI for setup
 * Different conversation agents using different API keys for tracability in developer console on Groq cloud.

Groq offers fast inference speed with reasonable pricing.
